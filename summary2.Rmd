## Take Home Message:{-}

IEP should transition to electronic data entry in order to improve efficiency and data quality.

Digital data entry methods have the potential to significantly increase the turn-around data from survey to  publication by reducing field entry errors, eliminating manual entry QC checks, and improving overall processing efficiency. 

Recent innovations in electronic data transfer, cloud processing and AI technology have been integrated into most commercially available data collection software;  these tools provide high-performance solutions, and some are genuinely providing a user-friendly development interface.

## Problem:

IEP still uses paper data sheets for most surveys.  Several surveys have tried out different e-devices for collecting field data, but they haven't been broadly adopted and people are not sure which ones are best.  

This bookdown document is set-up as an **Open-access Repository for Information related to Electronic Field Data Entry Software/Hardware for IEP Survey Applications**.

This document is intended as resource for IEP survey leads in selecting and deploying digital data-entry procedures.  

The initial information was gathered from interviews and presentations organized during a IEP Data Users Working Group sub-team (6/2022-6/2023).  

A Github-based bookdown framework has been established to support open sharing and on-going community updates as survey teams add new digital data-entry tools to their program.  


## Method: {-}

The DUWG formed a subteam and carried out the following steps:

1. **Poll IEP survey teams** to learn what digital data entry tools are currently used within the IEP network; 
2. **Evaluate the top software tools** with interviews/presentations from experienced users and product vendors; 
3. **Conduct software trials** using apps specifically configured for IEP survey data collections;
4. **Continue to encourage participation** to grow this IEP community sharing and exchange of technical information using an Open-document forum.

```{r proscons, echo = FALSE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  tab.cap='speakers', out.width='100%', tab.asp=.75, tab.align='left'}

library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(here)

pc<- as.data.frame(readRDS(here("proscons.rds"))) 

# Replace NAs with empty strings using replace()
pc[is.na(pc)] <- ""


pc %>%
  # Group by category column and collapse repeating values
  group_by(Software) %>%
  mutate(Software = ifelse(duplicated(Software), "", Software))  %>%

kable(pc, format = "html", escape = F, caption = "Summary Pros and Cons of Field Data Entry Apps Reviewed.", booktabs = TRUE,align='l') %>%
  kable_paper() %>% 
  # kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),full_width = FALSE, fixed_thead = TRUE,
  #               font_size = 20) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width =FALSE, fixed_thead = TRUE, font_size = 18) %>%
  #column_spec(1, width_min = "4cm", bold = TRUE, italic = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, width_max = "4.5cm", bold = TRUE, italic = F) %>%
  #column_spec(2, width_min = "6cm", bold = F, italic = F) %>%
  column_spec(2, width_max = "7cm", bold = F, italic = F) %>%
  #column_spec(3, width_min = "10cm", bold = F, italic = F) %>%
  column_spec(3, width_max = "10cm", bold = F, italic = F) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "800px")

```


## Impact: {-}

Adopting e-devices will mean some time/entry spent in developing the platforms and software and training staff, but long-term savings in data entry time and data quality will be worth it.
