# Expert Network   {#expnet}

One of the goal the e-device sub-group was to develop a listing of IEP associated scientists and staff who have expertise in different software approaches.  The names listed here are those who are willing to be a contact by anyone within IEP who is interested in the corresponding Software or Hardware listed. One caveat is that the listed personnel would not be able to replace a full-time technical support staff or programmer, and so reasonable consideration is needed to maintain this type of network resource.
